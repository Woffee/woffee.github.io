K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning and statistical modeling to evaluate the performance of a predictive model. It involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or folds of approximately equal size. The model is then trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set. The performance metrics obtained from each fold are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model’s generalization performance. Common values for k are 5 and 10, but other values can also be used depending on the dataset size and complexity.</p> <h3 id="q2-how-do-you-use-k-fold-cross-validation">Q2. How do you use K-fold cross validation?</h3> <p>A. K-fold cross-validation is used to assess the performance of a machine learning model and to estimate its generalization ability. Here are the steps to utilize K-fold cross-validation:</p> <ol> <li>Split the data: Divide your dataset into k equal-sized subsets (folds). Typically, k is chosen as 5 or 10, but you can adjust it based on your needs.</li> <li>Train and validate: Iterate over the k folds. In each iteration, use k-1 folds for training the model and the remaining fold for validation. Train your model on the training folds and evaluate its performance on the validation fold.</li> <li>Performance metrics: Calculate the performance metric(s) of interest (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for each fold. These metrics quantify how well the model generalizes to unseen data.</li> <li>Average the results: Average the performance metrics obtained from the k folds to obtain a more robust estimate of the model’s performance. This average value represents the overall performance of the model.</li> <li>Model selection and tuning: Based on the cross-validation results, you can compare different models or hyperparameter settings and select the one that performs the best on average across the folds.</li> <li>Final evaluation: After selecting the model or hyperparameters, you can retrain the model using the entire dataset and evaluate its performance on a separate test set to obtain a final performance estimation. K-fold cross-validation helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and provides a more reliable assessment of how well the model is expected to perform on unseen data.</li> </ol> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Guys! so far, we have discussed various aspects of the K-Fold Cross Validation Technique and its importance in the Machine Learning model for production, parameter selection with a classical example. I trust this article would help you all to understand this topic better. If you ask me if we have any disadvantages of this, my answer would be Yes! That is nothing but slow in execution than straightforward training and test. In spite of this small drawback, K Fold cross-validation plays a critical role in the Machine Learning world.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PHD"/><category term="Code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[K-fold cross-validation is a technique for evaluating predictive models.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Write the Scope of the Study</title><link href="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/scope-of-study/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Write the Scope of the Study"/><published>2023-06-12T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-12T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/scope-of-study</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/scope-of-study/"><![CDATA[<p>Source: <a href="https://www.discoverphds.com/blog/scope-of-the-study">https://www.discoverphds.com/blog/scope-of-the-study</a></p> <p>The scope of the study is defined at the start of the research project before data collection begins. It is used by researchers to set the boundaries and limitations within which the study will be performed.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-scope-of-the-study">What is the Scope of the Study?</h2> <p>The scope of the study refers to the boundaries within which your research project will be performed; this is sometimes also called the scope of research. To define the scope of the study is to define all aspects that will be considered in your research project. It is also just as important to make clear what aspects will not be covered; i.e. what is outside of the scope of the study.</p> <h2 id="why-is-the-scope-of-the-study-important">Why is the Scope of the Study Important?</h2> <p>The scope of the study is always considered and agreed upon in the early stages of the project, before any data collection or experimental work has started. This is important because it focuses the work of the proposed study down to what is practically achievable within a given timeframe.</p> <p>A well-defined research or study scope enables a researcher to give clarity to the study outcomes that are to be investigated. It makes clear why specific data points have been collected whilst others have been excluded.</p> <p>Without this, it is difficult to define an end point for a research project since no limits have been defined on the work that could take place. Similarly, it can also make the approach to answering a research question too open ended.</p> <h2 id="how-do-you-write-the-scope-of-the-study">How do you Write the Scope of the Study?</h2> <p>In order to write the scope of the study that you plan to perform, you must be clear on the research parameters that you will and won’t consider. These parameters usually consist of the sample size, the duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the methodology and any geographical or monetary constraints.</p> <p>Each of these parameters will have limits placed on them so that the study can practically be performed, and the results interpreted relative to the limitations that have been defined. These parameters will also help to shape the direction of each research question you consider.</p> <p>The term limitations’ is often used together with the scope of the study to describe the constraints of any parameters that are considered and also to clarify which parameters have not been considered at all. Make sure you get the balance right here between not making the scope too broad and unachievable, and it not being too restrictive, resulting in a lack of useful data.</p> <p>The sample size is a commonly used parameter in the definition of the research scope. For example, a research project involving human participants may define at the start of the study that 100 participants will be recruited. This number will be determined based on an understanding of the difficulty in recruiting participants to studies and an agreement of an acceptable period of time in which to recruit this number.</p> <p>Any results that are obtained by the research group can then be interpreted by others with the knowledge that the study was capped to 100 participants and an acceptance of this as a limitation of the study. In other words, it is acknowledged that recruiting 100 rather than 1,000 participants has limited the amount of data that could be collected, however this is an acceptable limitation due to the known difficulties in recruiting so many participants (e.g. the significant period of time it would take and the costs associated with this).</p> <h2 id="example-of-a-scope-of-the-study">Example of a Scope of the Study</h2> <p>The follow is a (hypothetical) example of the definition of the scope of the study, with the research question investigating <em>the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health</em>.</p> <p>Whilst the immediate negative health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been well documented, the impact of the virus on the mental health (MH) of young adults (age 18-24 years) is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to report on MH changes in population group due to the pandemic.</p> <p>The scope of the study is limited to recruiting 100 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 24 who will be contacted using their university email accounts. This recruitment period will last for a maximum of 2 months and will end when either 100 volunteers have been recruited or 2 months have passed. Each volunteer to the study will be asked to complete a short questionnaire in order to evaluate any changes in their MH.</p> <p>From this example we can immediately see that the scope of the study has placed a constraint on the sample size to be used and/or the time frame for recruitment of volunteers. It has also introduced a limitation by only opening recruitment to people that have university emails; i.e. anyone that does not attend university will be excluded from this study.</p> <p>This may be an important factor when interpreting the results of this study; the comparison of MH during the pandemic between those that do and do not attend university, is therefore outside the scope of the study here. We are also told that the methodology used to assess any changes in MH are via a questionnaire. This is a clear definition of how the outcome measure will be investigated and any other methods are not within the scope of research and their exclusion may be a limitation of the study.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The scope of the study is important to define as it enables a researcher to focus their research to within achievable parameters.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Blog"/><category term="PHD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post you will learn exactly what the scope of the study means, why it is important in your research, how you would write one and finally you’ll be presented with an example scope of a study.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Show labels when hovering over a point</title><link href="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/Matplotlib-Show-labels-when-hovering-over-a-point/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Show labels when hovering over a point"/><published>2023-01-13T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-13T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/Matplotlib-Show-labels-when-hovering-over-a-point</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2023/Matplotlib-Show-labels-when-hovering-over-a-point/"><![CDATA[<p>Show labels when hovering over a point.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/matplotlib-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/matplotlib-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/matplotlib-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/matplotlib.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Show labels when hovering over a point. </div> <p>This code is modified based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7908636/possible-to-make-labels-appear-when-hovering-over-a-point-in-matplotlib">here</a>.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

We propose DeepVD, a graph-based neural network VD model that emphasizes on class-separation features between vulnerability and benign code. DeepVD leverages three types of class-separation features at different levels of abstraction: statement types (similar to Part-of-Speech tagging), Post-Dominator Tree (covering regular flows of execution), and Exception Flow Graph (covering the exception and error-handling flows). We conducted several experiments to evaluate DeepVD in a real-world vulnerability dataset of 303 projects with 13,130 vulnerable methods. Our results show that DeepVD relatively improves over the state-of-the-art ML/DL-based VD approaches 13%–29.6% in precision, 15.6%–28.9% in recall, and 16.4%–25.8% in F-score. Our ablation study confirms that our designed features and components help DeepVD achieve high class-separability for vulnerability and benign code. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track/155/DeepVD-Toward-Class-Separation-Features-for-Neural-Network-Vulnerability-Detection <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PHD"/><category term="DL"/><category term="Publications"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepVD - Toward Class-Separation Features for Neural Network Vulnerability Detection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">QA4GIS</title><link href="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QA4GIS"/><published>2021-07-19T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-07-19T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS/"><![CDATA[<p>Community-based question answering websites have attracted more and more scholars and developers to discuss domain knowledge and software development. In this article, we focus on the GIS section of the Stack Exchange website and develop a novel approach, QA4GIS, a deep learning-based system for question answering tasks with a deep neural network (DNN) model to extract the representation of the query–API document pair. We use the LambdaMART model to rerank the candidate API documents. We begin with an empirical analysis of the questions and answers, demonstrating that API documents could answer 52.93% of the questions. Then we evaluate QA4GIS by comparing it with 10 other baselines. The experiment results show that QA4GIS can improve 21.39% on the MAP score and 22.34% on the MRR score compared with the best baseline SIF. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Wang, W., Li, Y., Wang, S., &amp; Ye, X.
