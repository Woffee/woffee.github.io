We propose DeepVD, a graph-based neural network VD model that emphasizes on class-separation features between vulnerability and benign code. DeepVD leverages three types of class-separation features at different levels of abstraction: statement types (similar to Part-of-Speech tagging), Post-Dominator Tree (covering regular flows of execution), and Exception Flow Graph (covering the exception and error-handling flows). We conducted several experiments to evaluate DeepVD in a real-world vulnerability dataset of 303 projects with 13,130 vulnerable methods. Our results show that DeepVD relatively improves over the state-of-the-art ML/DL-based VD approaches 13%–29.6% in precision, 15.6%–28.9% in recall, and 16.4%–25.8% in F-score. Our ablation study confirms that our designed features and components help DeepVD achieve high class-separability for vulnerability and benign code. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track/155/DeepVD-Toward-Class-Separation-Features-for-Neural-Network-Vulnerability-Detection <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="PHD"/><category term="DL"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepVD - Toward Class-Separation Features for Neural Network Vulnerability Detection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">QA4GIS</title><link href="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QA4GIS"/><published>2021-07-19T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-07-19T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://woffee.github.io/blog/2021/QA4GIS/"><![CDATA[<p>Community-based question answering websites have attracted more and more scholars and developers to discuss domain knowledge and software development. In this article, we focus on the GIS section of the Stack Exchange website and develop a novel approach, QA4GIS, a deep learning-based system for question answering tasks with a deep neural network (DNN) model to extract the representation of the query–API document pair. We use the LambdaMART model to rerank the candidate API documents. We begin with an empirical analysis of the questions and answers, demonstrating that API documents could answer 52.93% of the questions. Then we evaluate QA4GIS by comparing it with 10 other baselines. The experiment results show that QA4GIS can improve 21.39% on the MAP score and 22.34% on the MRR score compared with the best baseline SIF. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Wang, W., Li, Y., Wang, S., &amp; Ye, X.
